# Token-2022-support Pumpfun Contract
As the former pumpfun contracts only support amm pool on Raydium Protocol, they can't support Extension Token(TOKEN-2022).

This smart contracty supports clmm pool on the Raydium protocol, so that user can finally launch Token2022 on the pump.

This contract is cusomized, so it is specially for who wants to build the Pump.fun-like but much better project on the Solana.
